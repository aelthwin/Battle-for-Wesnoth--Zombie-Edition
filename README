The game's license is described in COPYING.  Note that for artwork and
music, we interpret "preferred form of the work for making modifications" as
the modifiable form that the author chooses to ship us for the source tree.

See INSTALL for instructions on how to build the game from source code.

A (translated) description of how to play the game can be found in 
doc/manual/manual.*.html .
