.SH NAME
wesnoth \- Battle for Wesnoth, a turn\-based fantasy strategy game
.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.
\fBwesnoth\fP [\fIOPTIONS\fP] [\fIPATH_TO_DATA\fP]
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.
Battle for \fBWesnoth\fP is a turn\-based fantasy strategy game.

Defeat all enemy leaders using a well\-chosen cadre of troops, taking care to
manage your resources of gold and villages. All units have their own
strengths and weaknesses; to win, deploy your forces to their best advantage
while denying your foes the chance to do the same. As units gain experience,
they acquire new abilities and become more powerful. Play in your own
language and test your skill against a smart computer opponent, or join
Wesnoth's large community of on\-line players. Create your own custom units,
scenarios or campaigns, and share them with others.

scenarios. The default scenario is campaign's first scenario.
.TP 
\fB\-\-config\-dir\fP\fI\ name\fP

Documents\eMy Games" for windows.  You can also specify an absolute path for
the configuration directory outside the $HOME or "My Documents\eMy Games"
.TP 
\fB\-\-config\-path\fP
prints the path of the user configuration directory and exits.
.TP 
\fB\-\-data\-dir <directory>\fP
overrides the data directory with the one specified
.TP 
\fB\-d, \-\-debug\fP
enables additional command mode options in\-game (see the wiki page at
http://www.wesnoth.org/wiki/CommandMode for more information about command
mode).
.TP 
\fB\-e,\ \-\-editor\fP\fI\ file\fP
start the in\-game map editor directly. If \fIfile\fP is specified, equivalent
to \fB\-l \-\-load\fP

displays the number of frames per second the game is currently running at,
in a corner of the screen.
.TP 
\fB\-f, \-\-fullscreen\fP
runs the game in full screen mode.
.TP 
\fB\-\-gunzip\fP\fI\ infile.gz\fP

\fIinfile\fP.
.TP 
\fB\-h, \-\-help\fP
displays a summary of command line options to standard output, and exits.
.TP 
\fB\-l,\ \-\-load\fP\fI\ file\fP
loads the savegame \fIfile\fP from the standard save game directory.  If the
\fB\-e\fP or \fB\-\-editor\fP option is used as well, starts the editor with the map

map dialog opened there.
.TP 
\fB\-\-log\-\fP\fIlevel\fP\fB=\fP\fIdomain1\fP\fB,\fP\fIdomain2\fP\fB,\fP\fI...\fP
sets the severity level of the log domains.  \fBall\fP can be used to match any

lists defined log domains (only the ones containing \fBfilter\fP if used) and
exits
.TP 
\fB\-\-max\-fps\fP
the number of frames per second the game can show, the value should be
between the 1 and 1000, the default is \fB50\fP.
.TP 
\fB\-m, \-\-multiplayer\fP
runs a multiplayer game. There are additional options that can be used
together with \fB\-\-multiplayer\fP as explained below. Only these additional
options can follow \fB\-\-multiplayer\fP.
.TP 
\fB\-\-no\-delay\fP
runs the game without any delays for graphic benchmarking. This is

.TP 
\fB\-\-preprocess, \-p[=<define1>,<define2>,...] <file/folder> <target directory>\fP
preprocesses a specified file/folder. The file(s) will be written in
specified target directory: a plain cfg file and a processed cfg file. If a
folder is specified, it will be preprocessed recursively based on the known
preprocessor rules. The common macroses from the data/core/macros will be
preprocessed before the specified resources.  \fBdefine1,define2,...\fP \- the
extra defines will be added before processing the files. If you want to add
them you must add the '=' character before.  If 'SKIP_CORE' is in the define
list the data/core won't be preprocessed.  Example: \fB\-p
~/wesnoth/data/campaigns/tutorial ~/result\fP or
\fB\-p=MULTIPLAYER,MY_OWN_CAMPAIGN ~/wesnoth/data/campaign/camp ~/result\fP
.TP 
\fB\-\-preprocess\-input\-macros <source file>\fP

[preproc_define]s to be included before preprocessing.
.TP 
\fB\-\-preprocess\-output\-macros [<target file>]\fP
used only by the '\-\-preprocess' command.  Will output all preprocessed
macros in the target file. If the file is not specified the output will be
file '_MACROS_.cfg' in the target directory of preprocess's command.  This
switch should be typed before the \-\-preprocess command.
.TP 
\fB\-r\ \fP\fIX\fP\fBx\fP\fIY\fP\fB,\ \-\-resolution\ \fP\fIX\fP\fBx\fP\fIY\fP

.TP 
\fB\-w, \-\-windowed\fP

.
.SH "Options for \-\-multiplayer"
.
The side\-specific multiplayer options are marked with \fInumber\fP.  \fInumber\fP
has to be replaced by a side number. It usually is 1 or 2 but depends on the
number of players possible in the chosen scenario.
.TP 
\fB\-\-ai_config\fP\fInumber\fP\fB=\fP\fIvalue\fP
selects a configuration file to load for the AI controller for this side.
.TP 
\fB\-\-algorithm\fP\fInumber\fP\fB=\fP\fIvalue\fP
selects a non\-standard algorithm to be used by the AI controller for this
side. Available values: \fBidle_ai\fP and \fBsample_ai\fP.
.TP 
\fB\-\-controller\fP\fInumber\fP\fB=\fP\fIvalue\fP
selects the controller for this side. Available values: \fBhuman\fP and \fBai\fP.
.TP 
\fB\-\-era=\fP\fIvalue\fP
use this option to play in the selected era instead of the \fBDefault\fP
era. The era is chosen by an id. Eras are described in the
\fBdata/multiplayer/eras.cfg\fP file.
.TP 
\fB\-\-exit\-at\-end\fP
exits once the scenario is over, without displaying victory/defeat dialog
which requires the user to click OK.  This is also used for scriptable
benchmarking.
.TP 
\fB\-\-nogui\fP
runs the game without the GUI. Must appear before \fB\-\-multiplayer\fP to have
the desired effect.
.TP 
\fB\-\-parm\fP\fInumber\fP\fB=\fP\fIname\fP\fB:\fP\fIvalue\fP
sets additional parameters for this side. This parameter depends on the
options used with \fB\-\-controller\fP and \fB\-\-algorithm\fP.  It should only be
useful for people designing their own AI. (not yet documented completely)
.TP 
\fB\-\-scenario=\fP\fIvalue\fP
selects a multiplayer scenario by id. The default scenario id is
\fBmultiplayer_The_Freelands\fP.
.TP 
\fB\-\-side\fP\fInumber\fP\fB=\fP\fIvalue\fP
selects a faction of the current era for this side. The faction is chosen by
an id. Factions are described in the data/multiplayer.cfg file.
.TP 
\fB\-\-turns=\fP\fIvalue\fP
sets the number of turns for the chosen scenario. The default is \fB50\fP.
.
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
.
Normal exit status is 0. An exit status of 1 indicates an (SDL, video,
fonts, etc) initialization error. An exit status of 2 indicates an error
with the command line options.
