.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.
Battle for
.B Wesnoth
is a turn-based fantasy strategy game.

Defeat all enemy leaders using a well-chosen cadre of troops, taking
care to manage your resources of gold and villages. All units have
their own strengths and weaknesses; to win, deploy your forces to
their best advantage while denying your foes the chance to do the
same. As units gain experience, they acquire new abilities and
become more powerful. Play in your own language and test your skill
against a smart computer opponent, or join Wesnoth's large community
of on-line players. Create your own custom units, scenarios or
campaigns, and share them with others.
.
.SH OPTIONS
.
.TP
.BI --bpp \ number
sets BitsPerPixel value. Example:
.B --bpp 32
.TP
.B -c, --campaign[[<difficulty>] <id_campaign> [<id_scenario>]]
goes directly to the campaign based on the parameters.
The difficulty is a number between 1 and current campaign's difficulties number.  The default difficulty is 1.
The scenario must be one of the campaign's child scenarios. The default scenario is campaign's first scenario.
.TP
.BI --config-dir \ name
sets the user configuration directory to
.I name
under $HOME or "My Documents\\My Games" for windows.
You can also specify an absolute path for the configuration directory outside
the $HOME or "My Documents\\My Games"
.TP
.B --config-path
prints the path of the user configuration directory and exits.
.TP
.B --data-dir <directory>
overrides the data directory with the one specified
.TP
.B -d, --debug
enables additional command mode options in-game
(see the wiki page at http://www.wesnoth.org/wiki/CommandMode for more information about command mode).
.TP
.BI -e,\ --editor \ file
start the in-game map editor directly. If
.I file
is specified, equivalent to
.B -l --load
.TP
.B --fps
displays the number of frames per second the game is currently running
at, in a corner of the screen.
.TP
.B -f, --fullscreen
runs the game in full screen mode.
.TP
.BI --gunzip \ infile.gz
decompresses a file which should be in gzip format and stores it
without the .gz suffix. The
.I infile.gz
will be removed.
.TP
.BI --gzip \ infile
compresses a file in gzip format, stores it as
.IR infile .gz
and removes
.IR infile .
.TP
.B -h, --help
displays a summary of command line options to standard output, and exits.
.TP
.BI -l,\ --load \ file
loads the savegame
.I file
from the standard save game directory.
If the
.B -e
or
.B --editor
option is used as well, starts the editor with the map from
.I file
open. If it is a directory, the editor will start with a load map dialog opened there.
.TP
.BI --log- level = domain1 , domain2 , ...
sets the severity level of the log domains.

level is used.
.TP
.B --logdomains\ [filter]
lists defined log domains (only the ones containing
.B filter
if used) and exits
.TP
.B --max-fps
the number of frames per second the game can show, the value should be between
the 1 and 1000, the default is
.BR 50 .
.TP
.B -m, --multiplayer
runs a multiplayer game. There are additional options that can be used
together with
.B --multiplayer
as explained below. Only these additional options can follow

directory: a plain cfg file and a processed cfg file. If a folder is specified, it will
be preprocessed recursively based on the known preprocessor rules. The common macroses
from the data/core/macros will be preprocessed before the specified resources.
.B define1,define2,...
- the extra defines will be added before processing the files. If you want to add them
you must add the '=' character before.
If 'SKIP_CORE' is in the define list the data/core won't be preprocessed.

.SH Options for --multiplayer
.
The side-specific multiplayer options are marked with
.IR number .
.I number
has to be replaced by a side number. It usually is 1 or 2 but depends on
the number of players possible in the chosen scenario.
.TP
.BI --ai_config number = value
selects a configuration file to load for the AI controller for this side.
.TP
.BI --algorithm number = value
selects a non-standard algorithm to be used by the AI controller for
this side. Available values:
.B idle_ai
and
.BR sample_ai .
.TP
.BI --controller number = value
selects the controller for this side. Available values:
.B human
and
.BR ai .
.TP
.BI --era= value
use this option to play in the selected era instead of the

era. The era is chosen by an id. Eras are described in the
.B "data/multiplayer/eras.cfg"
file.
.TP
.B --exit-at-end
exits once the scenario is over, without displaying victory/defeat dialog which requires the user to click OK.
This is also used for scriptable benchmarking.
.TP
.B --nogui
runs the game without the GUI. Must appear before
.B --multiplayer
to have the desired effect.
.TP
.BI --parm number = name : value
sets additional parameters for this side. This parameter depends on the
options used with
.B --controller
and
.BR --algorithm .
It should only be useful for people designing their own AI. (not yet
documented completely)
.TP
.BI --scenario= value
selects a multiplayer scenario by id. The default scenario id is
.BR multiplayer_The_Freelands .
.TP
.BI --side number = value
selects a faction of the current era for this side. The faction is
chosen by an id. Factions are described in the data/multiplayer.cfg
file.
.TP
.BI --turns= value
sets the number of turns for the chosen scenario. The default is
.BR 50 .
