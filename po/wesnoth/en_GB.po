#~ "strengthening itself in preparation for the next armed conflict. Orcs are "

#~ "\n"
#~ "Orc societies are based on little else but strength; might makes right, "
#~ "and a leader leads and survives only as long as no one manages to wrest "
#~ "the title from him. A constant struggle for power simmers among potential "
#~ "tribal chiefs. An orcish leader rarely lives more than a handful of years "
#~ "to enjoy his absolute authority before being killed for his position — "
#~ "although history knows some notable exceptions. Orcs hold no particular "
#~ "honor code and while indisputable raw strength is usually the preferred "
#~ "method of displaying power, assassination, poisoning and backstabbing are "
#~ "completely viable means to further one’s own goals.\n"

#~ "Orcs mostly live in rural areas, often in foothills or mountainous "
#~ "regions, sometimes in caves. They grow no crops nor keep livestock, but "
#~ "are competent hunters as a result of their physical stature and "
#~ "brutality. Due to their large numbers they are capable of hunting an area "
#~ "virtually clean of anything larger than rodents in relatively short "
#~ "period of time. Due to this and their unstable leadership, orcish tribes "
#~ "tend to lead a semi-nomadic lifestyle, never settling in one region for "
#~ "too long. The larger tribes may establish themselves firmly in an area "
#~ "for years or even decades and build large encampments almost resembling "
#~ "cities, but even these are easily dismantled and abandoned if there is a "
#~ "need to relocate the horde.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The oldest known orcs have been around 50 to 60 years of age, but very "
#~ "few individuals ever live to see over two or three decades before meeting "
#~ "their end either in war or by the hand of one of their kin. The oldest "
#~ "orcs are often shamans, which are perhaps the only ones most of their "
#~ "kind sees as being trustworthy and neutral. The origins of this custom "
#~ "are unknown, as the shamans do not directly contribute much to orcish "
#~ "societies but only act as advisors — not something orcs tend to otherwise "
#~ "tolerate. Shamans are in many ways the opposite of most other orcs: they "
#~ "are often physically withered and frail in comparison and lack skill in "
#~ "battle. Despite their reliance on raw strength, not nearly all orcs are "
#~ "destined to grow to possess any. Many orcs are born smaller and weaker "
#~ "than the rest, and already almost as newborns are put in their place by "
#~ "their stronger siblings. The stronger ones will routinely grab most of "
#~ "the food and thus grow stronger still, while their weaker siblings do "
#~ "not. Many of these individuals tend to specialise in other skills, like "
