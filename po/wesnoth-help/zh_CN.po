"makes them extremely vulnerable to cold attacks. Despite their magical "
"nature, drakes are incapable of channeling magic in a controlled manner. "

"\n"

"feared — <ref>dst='dominant' text='dominant'</ref> who rules the society "
"with an iron fist. Every drake is expected to earn their place in the strict "
"hierarchy, to obey their superiors and command their inferiors. Entry to the "
"ruling elite is only possible through challenging and defeating a superior "
"in single combat, which is the way the hierarchy within the elite itself is "
"established. The use of deception of any kind towards any fellow drake is, "
"without exception, seen as cowardly and unacceptable.\n"
"\n"
"While their warlike nature and sense of territory drives them to defend "
"their territories savagely, drakes rarely invade or trespass on areas "
"already occupied by the other major races. Instead, they settle in "
"unpopulated areas to establish their own territory there. They primarily "
"feed on large game they hunt in the lowlands around their homes, but "
"hatchlings and lower caste drakes are known to feed also on certain of moss "
"and fungi they cultivate deep in their caverns. The only technology drakes "
"value is armor- and weapon-smithing, and neither know or need other science "
"and culture besides this. However the few implements they do fashion are "
"almost unrivaled in quality, only matched by those produced in the finest "
"Dwarvish foundries.\n"
"\n"
"Drakes are hatched from eggs and usually live naturally between 20 to 30 "
"years. Death in battle is the most preferred way for a drake to leave this "
"world. Unlike the elder members of other races, drakes naturally grow more "
"aggressive and reckless towards the ends of their natural lives, perhaps to "

"The dwarves are a race famed for their miners, blacksmiths, merchants and "

"tell of a time long forgotten when their people began emerging from their "
"underground world through caves. Nothing is known about their life prior to "
"their arrival, or their reasons for entering the surface world, but they "
"have been an integral part of the history of the continent since. Soon after "
"their emergence from the underground, the dwarves entered into conflict with "
"the original inhabitants of the land, the elves. The original reason for "
"their dispute has been lost to history, but the two races have since fought "
"three long wars, interrupted by a few decades of peace. During these wars "
"the dwarves could not dislodge the elves from the deep forests in the south, "
"but managed to consolidate their position in hills and the mountains in the "
"north of the continent, known now as the Northlands. Since then they have "
"constructed fantastic fortifications and settlements deep within the "
"mountains and crags of their territory.\n"
"\n"
"Possibly due to their isolation, the dwarves are generally distrustful or "
"hostile towards most other races, particularly the elves. The single "
"exception to this temperament is towards humans. This could be traced back "
"to the era of Haldric I and the arrival of humans and orcs to the continent. "
"At this point the dwarves began allowing some humans, mostly dissidents and "
"outlaws from the Kingdom of Wesnoth, to settle in certain areas of the "
"Northlands. Their motivation was unsurprising. The plight of these "
"individuals reminded the dwarves of their early history of persecution, "
"eliciting a sense of solidarity. The dwarves also had much to gain in "
"forming a bond with these outcasts. They would settle in areas where dwarves "
"disliked living themselves; plains, forests, and swamps, freeing them from "
"defending these areas.\n"
"\n"
"Dwarves are of small stature by human measure, but they are by no means "
"fragile. Their warriors, tough and powerful are both feared and respected "
"throughout the continent for their prowess in battle. In addition, dwarves "
"are known for their calculating intellects and superb craftsmanship. Dwarven "
"smiths are renowned for their deadly weapons and heavy armor. These "
"accouterments are unrivaled in quality, possibly only matched by those "
"produced by drake armorers. Their intelligence and natural inquisitiveness "
"has also made them the most technically advanced race on the continent. One "
"of their most famous, and feared, discoveries was a mysterious powder that "
"produces an immense explosion when exposed to fire or sparks. Certain dwarf "
"warriors use this powder to hurl small objects at tremendous speeds. Given "
"their technological inclinations, many dwarves tend to distrust magic users. "
"However some practice a form of magic based on the engraving of runes. "
"Called runesmiths, they use these carvings to enchant items in order to "

"animosity. Occasionally, a single strong chieftain may emerge to lead "

"\n"
"Orc societies are based on little else but strength; might makes right, and "
"a leader leads and survives only as long as no one manages to wrest the "

"\n"
"Orcs mostly live in rural areas, often in foothills or mountainous regions, "
"sometimes in caves. They grow no crops nor keep livestock, but are competent "
"hunters as a result of their physical stature and brutality. Due to their "
"large numbers they are capable of hunting an area virtually clean of "

"The oldest known orcs have been around 50 to 60 years of age, but very few "

"often shamans, which are perhaps the only ones most of their kind sees as "
"being trustworthy and neutral. The origins of this custom are unknown, as "
"the shamans do not directly contribute much to orcish societies but only act "
"as advisors — not something orcs tend to otherwise tolerate. Shamans are in "
"many ways the opposite of most other orcs: they are often physically "
"withered and frail in comparison and lack skill in battle. Despite their "
"reliance on raw strength, not nearly all orcs are destined to grow to "
"possess any. Many orcs are born smaller and weaker than the rest, and "
"already almost as newborns are put in their place by their stronger "

"They are also somewhat curious of their surroundings and many younger whelps "
