"Drakes are large, winged and fire-breathing creatures, reminiscent of true "
"dragons. On average, an adult drake stands around three meters tall and "
"easily weighs more than a man and a horse combined. Their skin is made up of "
"hard scales, resistant to most physical strikes except piercing and cold "
"damage. Most drakes are capable of true flight and can travel long distances "
"quickly. However, their sheer weight and bulk limits their flight ability "
"somewhat, making them ungainly in the air. Where possible, they make use of "
"terrain features such as hills, mountains and trees as launch points in "
"order to gain greater height and speed. Fortunately for their enemies, they "
"are still quite clumsy creatures and surprisingly slow in combat. This, "
"combined with their large size, renders them easy targets for those who dare "
"attack them.\n"
"\n"
"Drakes are inherently magical creatures, with a mysterious internal fire "
"fueling their very lives. This can easily be witnessed when one of their "
"kind perishes in combat; its internal fire is released, burning their "
"remains in to ashes. Their internal fire is also their greatest weakness; it "
"makes them extremely vulnerable to cold attacks. Despite their magical "
"nature, drakes are incapable of channeling magic in a controlled manner. "
"While the magic imbued within a drake’s body enables it to spit fire and "
"gives it life, they have no willful control over its functions of this "
"magic.\n"
"\n"
"<header>text='Society'</header>\n"
"Drakes are a relatively warlike race and their societies can be best "
"described as cultured martial societies. The core of a drake tribe is a "
"small group of veteran warriors headed by a mutually respected — or simply "
"feared — <ref>dst='dominant' text='dominant'</ref> who rules the society "
"with an iron fist. Every drake is expected to earn their place in the strict "
"hierarchy, to obey their superiors and command their inferiors. Entry to the "
"ruling elite is only possible through challenging and defeating a superior "
"in single combat, which is the way the hierarchy within the elite itself is "
"established. The use of deception of any kind towards any fellow drake is, "
"without exception, seen as cowardly and unacceptable.\n"
"\n"
"While their warlike nature and sense of territory drives them to defend "
"their territories savagely, drakes rarely invade or trespass on areas "
"already occupied by the other major races. Instead, they settle in "
"unpopulated areas to establish their own territory there. They primarily "
"feed on large game they hunt in the lowlands around their homes, but "
"hatchlings and lower caste drakes are known to feed also on certain of moss "
"and fungi they cultivate deep in their caverns. The only technology drakes "
"value is armor- and weapon-smithing, and neither know or need other science "
"and culture besides this. However the few implements they do fashion are "
"almost unrivaled in quality, only matched by those produced in the finest "
"Dwarvish foundries.\n"
"\n"
"Drakes are hatched from eggs and usually live naturally between 20 to 30 "
"years. Death in battle is the most preferred way for a drake to leave this "
"world. Unlike the elder members of other races, drakes naturally grow more "
"aggressive and reckless towards the ends of their natural lives, perhaps to "
"help ensure their place in the heroic legends of their kind.\n"
"\n"
"<header>text='Geography'</header>\n"
"Drakes originated from an archipelago of volcanic islands called "
"<ref>dst='morogor' text='Morogor'</ref> in the <ref>dst='great_ocean' "
"text='Great Ocean'</ref>. A combination of population pressure and the "
"subsidence of many of their home islands has caused colonies of drakes to "
"spread to the <ref>dst='great_continent' text='Great Continent'</ref>. "
"Drakes tend to make their homes in mountain caverns near volcanoes to "
"protect their eggs, hatchings and forges. While drakes naturally prefer "
"warmth, their internal fire is more than capable of sustaining them even in "
"a relatively cold climate, a feature which has allowed them to populate even "
"some of the mountains of the far north of the Great Continent."

"The dwarves are a race famed for their miners, blacksmiths, merchants and "
"warriors. Considered as the third oldest race on the great continent after "
"the elves and trolls, their early history is shrouded in mystery. Legends "
"tell of a time long forgotten when their people began emerging from their "
"underground world through caves. Nothing is known about their life prior to "
"their arrival, or their reasons for entering the surface world, but they "
"have been an integral part of the history of the continent since. Soon after "
"their emergence from the underground, the dwarves entered into conflict with "
"the original inhabitants of the land, the elves. The original reason for "
"their dispute has been lost to history, but the two races have since fought "
"three long wars, interrupted by a few decades of peace. During these wars "
"the dwarves could not dislodge the elves from the deep forests in the south, "
"but managed to consolidate their position in hills and the mountains in the "
"north of the continent, known now as the Northlands. Since then they have "
"constructed fantastic fortifications and settlements deep within the "
"mountains and crags of their territory.\n"
"\n"
"Possibly due to their isolation, the dwarves are generally distrustful or "
"hostile towards most other races, particularly the elves. The single "
"exception to this temperament is towards humans. This could be traced back "
"to the era of Haldric I and the arrival of humans and orcs to the continent. "
"At this point the dwarves began allowing some humans, mostly dissidents and "
"outlaws from the Kingdom of Wesnoth, to settle in certain areas of the "
"Northlands. Their motivation was unsurprising. The plight of these "
"individuals reminded the dwarves of their early history of persecution, "
"eliciting a sense of solidarity. The dwarves also had much to gain in "
"forming a bond with these outcasts. They would settle in areas where dwarves "
"disliked living themselves; plains, forests, and swamps, freeing them from "
"defending these areas.\n"
"\n"
"Dwarves are of small stature by human measure, but they are by no means "
"fragile. Their warriors, tough and powerful are both feared and respected "
"throughout the continent for their prowess in battle. In addition, dwarves "
"are known for their calculating intellects and superb craftsmanship. Dwarven "
"smiths are renowned for their deadly weapons and heavy armor. These "
"accouterments are unrivaled in quality, possibly only matched by those "
"produced by drake armorers. Their intelligence and natural inquisitiveness "
"has also made them the most technically advanced race on the continent. One "
"of their most famous, and feared, discoveries was a mysterious powder that "
"produces an immense explosion when exposed to fire or sparks. Certain dwarf "
"warriors use this powder to hurl small objects at tremendous speeds. Given "
"their technological inclinations, many dwarves tend to distrust magic users. "
"However some practice a form of magic based on the engraving of runes. "
"Called runesmiths, they use these carvings to enchant items in order to "
"augment certain aspects of their natures."

"Undead are not really a single race of creatures, although often treated as "
"such. Almost any dead creature can, by a sufficiently skilled necromancer, "
"be reanimated and rise again in undeath. Undead are for the most part "
"unnatural but mindless constructs, obeying whoever created them without "
"question nor thought. A greater mystery of necromancy is in how constructs "
"are sustained without continuous effort from the necromancer. An undead "
"creature does not require the constant attention of the necromancer to "
"command and sustain, but can work autonomously according to the commands of "
"it’s master. Only rarely, perhaps once every few months, does the "
"necromancer need to maintain his creation.\n"
"\n"
"Necromancy is almost solely limited to humans. Even the legends of magically "
"apt races like elves and mermen tell of very few of their kind who have ever "
"delved in the dark arts. It is surmised that necromantic magic requires "
"great adaptability and a flexible mind, extremes of which are most commonly "
"found in humans. The ultimate goal of most necromancers is to turn the same "
"art of preserving and imbuing life upon themselves, to alter themselves at "
"whatever cost, to ultimately escape death by preserving their own mind and "
"spirit.\n"
