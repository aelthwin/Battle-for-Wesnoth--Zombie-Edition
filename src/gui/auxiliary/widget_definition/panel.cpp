 * A panel is always enabled and can't be disabled. Instead it uses the
 * states as layers to draw on.
 *
 * The resolution for a panel also contains the following keys:
 * @begin{table}{config}
 *     top_border & unsigned & 0 &     The size which isn't used for the client
 *                                   area. $
 *     bottom_border & unsigned & 0 &  The size which isn't used for the client
 *                                   area. $
 *     left_border & unsigned & 0 &    The size which isn't used for the client
 *                                   area. $
 *     right_border & unsigned & 0 &   The size which isn't used for the client
 *                                   area. $
 * @end{table}
 *
 * The following layers exist:
 * * background, the background of the panel.
 * * foreground, the foreground of the panel.
