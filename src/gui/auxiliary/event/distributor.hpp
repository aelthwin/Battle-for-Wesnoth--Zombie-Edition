/**
 * @file
 * Contains the event distributor.
 *
 * The event distributor exists of several classes which are combined in one
 * templated tdistributor class. The classes are closly tight together.
 *
 * All classes have direct access to eachothers members since they should act
 * as one. (Since the buttons are a templated subclass it's not possible to use
 * private subclasses.)
 *
 * The tmouse_motion class handles the mouse motion and holds the owner of us
 * since all classes virtually inherit us.
 *
 * The tmouse_button classes are templated classes per mouse button, the
 * template parameters are used to make the difference between the mouse
 * buttons. Althought it's easily possible to add more mouse buttons in the
 * code several places only expect a left, middle and right button.
 *
 * tdistributor is the main class to be used in the user code. This class
 * contains the handling of the keyboard as well.
 *
 * @todo Finish hovering and tooltips.
 *
 * The code for these functions is available but commented out so that can be
 * used as example for how to implement it.
