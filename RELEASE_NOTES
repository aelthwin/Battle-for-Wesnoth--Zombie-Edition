This file is here to allow devs to easily add stuff in the release notes for the next release, it allows easy syncing with the release team, since you don't have to be around when the release takes place...

Just dump whatever you want to have mentioned in the release notes here. Please take care that it is in a way that allows copy&paste to the release notes. That is making sure that spelling/grammar/whatever is usable and that you are using complete sentences, not just single words. Please do use forum syntax and do *NOT* split lines after 80 chars!

Stuff that belongs in here:
* groundbreaking changes (new campaigns, extremely new feature, ...)
* changed dependencies (new things, version bumps, stuff that was removed)

The release team should empty this file after each release.

***

The add-on description box in the Download dialog has been improved and now displays extra information about the selected add-on, including bundled translations.

***

Custom attack ranges and types can now be translated. To do this for range "artillery" and damage type "explosive", add a top-level [+language] tag to your UMC as follows:
[code][+language]
    # Translate custom range
    range_artillery= _ "artillery"

    # Translate custom attack type
    type_explosive = _ "explosive"
[/language][/code]

Failing to do so will result in your ranges having odd names starting with 'UNTLB', indicating you should fix this.

***

Autotools are no longer a supported build system. Instead you should either switch to cmake or scons.
