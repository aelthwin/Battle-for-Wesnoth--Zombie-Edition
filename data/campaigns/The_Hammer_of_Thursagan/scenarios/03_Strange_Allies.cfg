    # Player controls Aiglondur's troops with Marth Tak's as allies;
    # the stinger is that if Marth Tak dies, you lose. The opponent,
    # Gothras, leads a large force of chaotic humans.  This should be
    # a medium-sized but serious fight.  The only terrain feature
    # fixed by storyline is a west-to-east road; player’s troops
    # should start near its west end, enemy near the east.
