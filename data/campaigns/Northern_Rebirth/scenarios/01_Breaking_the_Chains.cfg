        [part]
            story= _ "Far to the north of Wesnoth, and hard by the dwarven caves of Knalga, there was once a thriving mixed community known as Dwarven Doors. Food, wood, and cloth from all over Wesnoth and many elvish lands as well were brought here to be sold to the dwarves, while ores, metals and worked dwarven manufactures were bought here to be traded throughout the surface nations. Dwarves and humans worked and lived side by side; even the elves who came to trade mingled more with the other kindred races than was common elsewhere. Dwarven Doors grew populous and wealthy."
        [/part]
        [part]
            story= _ "The dwarves of Knalga, cannily reckoning the gains from trade, built strong fortifications around Dwarven Doors. The people who called it home, dwarven and human alike, knew that the wealth of their city might arouse envy from afar — hence they kept their weapons sharp, and reckoned themselves well able to fight off any bandit gang or petty warlord that could arise in the thinly-settled northlands."
        [/part]
        [part]
            story= _ "For many years it was indeed so. Dwarven Doors was a peaceful and prosperous place. Until the orcs came..."
        [/part]
        [part]
            story= _ "The raids were mere probes, at first, and the orcs mere rabble. But they grew more numerous, and threatening, and the raiding parties became war-bands and then companies. Then there arose a great warlord among the Bloody Sword tribe, the chieftain called Khazg Black-Tusk; and he raised an army, and besieged Dwarven Doors."

            # wmllint: local spelling unthreatened
            story= _ "It was a time of doom and great deeds, of fire and blood and slaughter. The men and dwarves of the city fought valiantly. But there were always, it seemed, more orcs to replace the slain, while the defenders could find no succor. Pleas for help went unheeded in other lands, for they were far away and felt unthreatened by the orcs, and were wrapped up in their own affairs and struggles."
        [/part]
        [part]
            story= _ "After a year and a day of grim battle the city fell. Its streets ran with gore. The dwarves were pushed back into the caverns of Knalga, while the humans of Dwarven Doors who survived the sack were enslaved by the orcs. Cut off from contact with the surface, the dwarves of Knalga fought on, but knew their utter subjugation could not be averted forever."
        [/part]
        [part]
            story= _ "Dark years passed; human generations grew up in slavery, and came near to forgetting that their ancestors had been free — and might have completely forgotten were it not for a fateful day in 518YW. That day that changed the lives of the people of Dwarven Doors — forever."

            # wmllint: local spelling dispiritedly
            story= _ "It was an early spring day like any other; the humans — joyless beneath the orcish whip — were dispiritedly planting the yearly crop. All at once, the war-drums of the orcs began pounding; harsh war-cries sounded as orcs mustered to gather their weapons and man their posts. Startled, the peasants looked around in alarm, and that was when they saw him."
        [/part]
        [part]
            story= _ "He came charging out of the woods, his cape streaming in the breeze, his sword flashing quicker than thought, and all around him, the hated orcs fell. To his right fought an elderly mage whose deep voice boomed incantations over the clamor of the battle while the very earth shook with the power of his spells. To his left, glowing with faerie fire, was a great lord of the elves. They were followed closely and supported by a small but powerful elvish army."

            #po: tyrant -> Queen Asheviere from Heir to the Throne.
            story= _ "Word quickly spread among the humans that this hero was none other than Prince Konrad of Wesnoth, faring to the ruins of Knalga to retrieve the Scepter of Fire and use it to save his homeland from the rule of a tyrant, and they stood, rooted to their places in awe."
        [/part]
        [part]
            story= _ "As quickly as it had begun, it was over. Konrad reached the entrance to the tunnels and ushered his men through. Then he turned one last time to face the peasants. Raising his sword in salute and farewell, he called out to them: <i>“Hold fast your hope, for one day you shall be free!”</i> Then he was gone."
        [/part]
        [part]
            story= _ "After that day, nothing could be the same. Hope rose in their hearts like a flame long-smothered but rekindled. The brightest and boldest of them began to plan and to train in secret. And the orcish masters, grown stupid from their own arrogance, did not see."

            story= _ "There was one among these peasants named Tallin. He had been a little child, barely out of his mother’s arms, when Konrad broke the Orcish host. But he never forgot that day. His father was a weaponsmith, his family used less brutally than most because the orcish masters put more value on that craft. In secret, his mother even taught him letters. As the boy grew to young manhood, he could touch blades, and dream. And he did."
        [/part]
        [part]
            story= _ "Then one day Al’Tar, the current ‘master’ of Dwarven Doors, was attacked by a neighboring tribe of orcs. Tallin seized his moment. Using knowledge born of years of watching, listening and planning, he managed to steal a few weapons and a small amount of Al’Tar’s gold. He fled to an abandoned ruin in the forest to rally his fellow peasants."
