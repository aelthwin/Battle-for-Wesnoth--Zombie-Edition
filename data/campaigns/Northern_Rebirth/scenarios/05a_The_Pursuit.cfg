Although the full extent of its power has not been fathomed, there are a few features about it that will be obvious to any master of lore. The wielder of this staff gains a dramatic increase in strength, speed and intelligence, and is granted the ability to fire devastating lightning bolts at at his opponents. Only a person who is good at heart and who is willing to sacrifice his life on the path of justice can wield this staff."
