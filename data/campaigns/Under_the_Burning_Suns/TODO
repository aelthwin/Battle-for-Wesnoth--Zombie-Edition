- The character sprites for Kaleh and Nym are old ones based on 1.0 and 
  not TCed; they look slightly wrong next to the recolored 2.0 sprites.

-Possibly give the "Emerald Wand of Poison" a better name, and possibly make the item accessible to units other than the Desert Shyde and the Desert Star.

-Give some textual clue about the locations of the coldsword and wand.
