    # random elves in the outer villages. If the player captures a village
    # before an undead unit does, he has a chance of finding a random elf
    # (picked from the $elf_pool array set up in prestart) to join him. However,
    # if an undead unit had captured the village first, there's nothing left.

    # The information about who captured a village first and whether the player
    # has visited the village already is stored in a container unique to each
    # village location, set when someone steps on the village for the first
    # time. For example if the undead capture the village at 30,8 first, the
