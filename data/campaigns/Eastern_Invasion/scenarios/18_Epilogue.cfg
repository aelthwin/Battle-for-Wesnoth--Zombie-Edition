            story= _ "When Mal-Ravanal fell, the living creatures under his banner broke and fled; the undead simply collapsed like puppets with their strings cut. As the lich’s death-scream echoed in the air, a vast and louring column of shadow arose from his corpse like smoke from an unclean fire; then it divided fivefold at its height, reaching for the heavens like a clutching hand.

Men let weapons fall from nerveless fingers and horses reared in terror as that great dark pall obscured the sun..."
