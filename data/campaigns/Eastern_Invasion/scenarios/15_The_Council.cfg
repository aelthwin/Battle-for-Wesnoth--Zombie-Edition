        [part]
            story= _ "The greatest seer in the land, Galdren, foresaw that some day, some day soon, a great evil would spread over the land. The king, naturally, was worried. The seer told him that the only way to stop the evil was to appoint a mage, versed well in combat with the spirits of darkness, to be the king’s advisor."
        [/part]
        [part]
            story= _ "In all the land, there were two magi of light that clearly stood out from the rest. A mage from the east named Ravan, and myself. The King, wishing to choose a good advisor, sent us both before Galdren. Then he conversed with the seer privately. None know what was said, but when he came out he announced that the seer was dead, and he had chosen me as his new advisor."
        [/part]
        [part]
            story= _ "Ravan took this quietly enough, we all thought, but now I think that this was when he began his fall. He went deep into conversation with the spirits of darkness, hoping to discover their weaknesses, but it was they who found his. In time, as all of the magi of death eventually do, he took his own life and reformed himself as a lich, one of the most powerful ones ever seen."
        [/part]
        [part]
            story= _ "One day, he disguised himself and came to the castle, where I was living. He demanded to see me, and the guards let him in, for then he was still a respected member of the court. When I came out, he revealed himself, named himself Mal-Ravanal, and challenged me to a duel."
        [/part]
        [part]
            story= _ "The guards, surprised by this sudden revelation, advanced to attack him. However, as he was now skilled in the magical art of teleportation, he simply vanished. And has not been seen since."
